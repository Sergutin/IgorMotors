## Technologies Used

  ### HTML
    I used HTML technology to structure and present the content of my Igor Motors Django project. HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental building block of web pages. Through the use of HTML, I was able to create the visual layout and arrangement of various elements within the project.

    With HTML, I defined the structure of each web page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and other components. By employing HTML tags and attributes, I organized the content into a logical hierarchy, ensuring proper formatting and readability for users.
    
  ### CSS
    CSS enhanced the visual appeal of my Igor Motors Django project. By defining styles for elements like colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive layouts, CSS ensured a consistent and attractive design across devices, elevating the user experience

  ### Python
    I utilized Python as the primary programming language for my Igor Motors Django project. Python's versatility and robustness were instrumental in building the backend functionality of the platform. I leveraged Django, a powerful Python web framework, to handle routing, database management, and user authentication.

    Python's clean and readable syntax facilitated efficient coding and debugging. With its extensive library support, I implemented various features such as handling user input, processing data, and integrating third-party services.
  ### Django
    Django, a high-level Python web framework, was the cornerstone of my Igor Motors project. With Django's built-in tools, I efficiently handled URL routing, database management, and user authentication. This framework streamlined the development process, allowing me to focus on creating a seamless and interactive platform for Igor Motors.
  ### Bootstrap 5
    Bootstrap 5, a popular front-end framework, played a vital role in shaping the visual layout and responsiveness of my Igor Motors project. By leveraging Bootstrap's pre-designed components and grid system, I established a consistent and modern design across the platform. This framework enabled efficient development and ensured a user-friendly experience, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. 
  ### Cloudinary
    Cloudinary was integral to optimizing media management in my Igor Motors project. As a cloud-based media storage and delivery platform, Cloudinary facilitated efficient uploading, storage, and delivery of images for cars and other visual content. This enhanced the platform's performance by ensuring quick loading times and high-quality images, contributing to a seamless user experience.
  ### Heroku PostgreSQL
    For database management in my Igor Motors project, I turned to Heroku PostgreSQL. This fully managed and scalable relational database service offered by Heroku ensured the efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. Heroku PostgreSQL's capabilities supported the seamless functioning of the platform, contributing to a reliable and robust user experience.
  ### Amazon AWS
    I harnessed the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for my Igor Motors project by utilizing Amazon S3 for efficient storage and Amazon IAM for secure access control. With Amazon S3, I seamlessly managed and stored media files, ensuring quick and reliable content delivery. Meanwhile, Amazon IAM provided granular control over user permissions, enhancing security and compliance throughout the platform.

<img src="./media/readme/light_d1.png" width=600px height=auto>
<img src="./media/readme/light_d2.png" width=600px height=auto>

    and 95-97% for mobile device:

    No broken links found, everything works as expected.

  ### Fixed Bugs
    During bug testing, it was discovered that the .gitignore file was not created, resulting in sensitive information being uploaded to GitHub. To address this issue, I recreated the database on PostgreSQL, updated all credentials in the env.py file and in the Heroku project settings, including the values for DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, and CLOUDINARY_URL.

    Also the env.py was accidentally committed twice and the data was changed completely on both occasions.

    During HTML code testing, there were several errors:

  <img src="./media/readme/html_bugs.png" width=600px height=auto>

    To fix them, I removed the trailing slash from the code line, removed <hr> as a child of the <ul> element, and replaced it with paddings to make the footer part look user-friendly.


  ### Unfixed Bugs
<p>There are no known unfixed bugs in the code</p>
